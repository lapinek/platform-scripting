Below is an example of attaching a debugger in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). You can check out details on setting debugging environment in [IntelliJ's docs](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/creating-and-editing-run-debug-configurations.html), but the general steps are outlined below:

1. Open your ForgeOps clone in IntelliJ.

1. Select "Run" > "Edit Configurations...".

    1. Select "Add New Configuration" ("+") and select "Remote" in the list of predefined templates.

        1. In "Configuration" tab, provide or verify the defaults for the following settings:

            1. Debugger mode: Attach to remote JVM
            1. Host: localhost
            1. Port: 5005
            1. Command line arguments for remote JVM (for JDK 9 or later): -agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=*:5005
            1. Use module classpath: forgeops

        1. Provide "Name" for your new configuration; for example, "forgeops".

        1. Select "Apply" or "OK".

1. In your staging area in IDM Dockerfile (for example, in `/path/to/forgeops/docker/7.0/idm/Dockerfile`) change the environment variable `JAVA_OPTS` according to the debugging settings in the IDM project itselfâ€”as described in the [Starting in Debug Mode](https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/idm/6.5/integrators-guide/#starting-in-debug-mode) section of the IDM Integrator's Guide. For example, in `/path/to/idm/openidm-runtime/src/main/resources/startup.sh` you may find:

    ```java
    if [ "$JPDA" = "jpda" ] ; then
    if [ -z "$JPDA_TRANSPORT" ]; then
        JPDA_TRANSPORT="dt_socket"
    fi
    if [ -z "$JPDA_ADDRESS" ]; then
        JPDA_ADDRESS="5005"
    fi
    if [ -z "$JPDA_SUSPEND" ]; then
        JPDA_SUSPEND="n"
    fi
    if [ -z "$JPDA_OPTS" ]; then
        JPDA_OPTS="-Djava.compiler=NONE -Xnoagent -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=$JPDA_TRANSPORT,address=$JPDA_ADDRESS,server=y,suspend=$JPDA_SUSPEND"
    fi
    OPENIDM_OPTS="$OPENIDM_OPTS $JPDA_OPTS"
    fi
    ```

    The resulting line in your Dockerfile might look like this:

    ```docker
    ENV JAVA_OPTS "-Djava.compiler=NONE -Xnoagent -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=5005,server=y,suspend=n -server -XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75"
    ```

    Make sure that the port you use in IntelliJ and in the Dockerfile are the same.

1. Run the following command in your terminal against your ForgeOps deployment:

    ```bash
    kubectl port-forward idm-pod-name 5005:5005
    ```

1. In IntelliJ, open a Groovy script located in your staging area that you'd like to debug. For example, `docker/7.0/idm/script/example.groovy`.

    Debugging a script in your staging area, with auto-sync or auto-deploy on, assures that you are debugging the same content as the one that is running in the container.

    In IntelliJ, you can now set breaking points in the script, start debugging, and then evaluate the script by making authorized request to the IDM `/script` endpoint. IntelliJ should react on messages coming from localhost:5005 and follow the code in your file.
